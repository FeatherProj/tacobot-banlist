# Tacobot Banlist
The public banlist for player who participated in tacobot activity.

## What is Tacobot?
Tacobot is the toxic group who uploads the mvm newbies/rude person to their own banlist. They votekick the person who is on banlist. Also they are known to be toxic to other mvm players.

## How to avoid playing with Tacobot players
* Play with your friends (Must be at least 4 friends to avoid playing with Tacobot). 
* Leave the server and do matchmaking again (Actually not recommended)
* Play on community mvm servers (e.g. Potato.TF, Pineapple.TF, LazyPurple, etc)

## Our Request
**We ask you not to use this project to insult the players publicly** who participated in Tacobot activities. If we do the same, it is no difference with Tacobot, so please don't do it. This project is just for listing the tacobot players for admins to easily ban them from their servers, not to insult them publicly.
